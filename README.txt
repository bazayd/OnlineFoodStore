This database includes the tables for user accounts, their respective data, and the data for the food store itself.  Node.js app.js file recieves requests from the user and calls functions written in database.js that query the sql database. Schema.sql holds the commands to build the entire ofsfood database needed for the webpage. Node.js is primary dependency. npm i command can be used inside /client/vite-project/ to install all other dependences.

Client/vite-project folder holds a Vite React environment.  This connects to the backend Node.js server via a proxy on the local host as of 3/5/25 on port 8080. To build the react development server into static files run npm run build in client/viteproject, then drag the dist folder it creates in to the /server folder.  Additionally you will have to copy all the images within the /client/vite-project/src/assets folder into the new /server/dist/assets folder.
