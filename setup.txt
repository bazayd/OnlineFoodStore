REQUIREMENTS ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Install Node.js LTS

Install Git
(setup git with ssh key to your computer)

Install MySql
(i needed to add mysql to path
to do this navigate to mysql bin directory
probably at C:\Program Files\MySQL Server 8.0\bin
once you find it copy this path should look like such above
hit windows
type env
click edit the system environment variables
click Enviroment Variables
in bottom half in system variables find variable path
click that shit
edit
new
past in the path
ok, ok, ok)
(remember the password you give mysql we will remove later it for the sake of development)

PRE-SETUP ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make folder for project

Open terminal

Navigate to folder

run: git init

run: git remote add origin git@github.com:bazayd/OnlineFoodStore

run: git pull origin main

MySQL-SET-UP ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Open VSCode

Open the folder you created

Double check you see client and server folders (as well as aditional txt files)

Open two integrated terminals

Navigate one to server folder

Navigate the other to vite-project folder within the client folder (these will run the backend node.js and frontend react development server respectively)

Select server terminal

run: mysql -u root -p

enter the password you gave it

should be within the mysql server

run: SET PASSWORD FOR root@localhost='';         (this removes the password, there is an .env file that the node.js server uses to authenticate you can change password of root on mysql and password in emv file accordingly)

In VSCode in the server folder find schema.MySql    (schema setup for notes app for testing purposes)

Copy everything inside

click back into mysql terminal

paste everything w/ right click (should do multiple commands at once to create database and table)

make sure to press enter to run last command

run: show databaes;

make sure there is the notes_app database

run: use notes_app;

run: show tables;

make sure there is notes table

run: select * from notes;

make sure you have two notes

run: exit

Node.js-SET-UP ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

get in server directory

run: node app.js        (this starts back end node server)

allow any permissions

Vite&React-SET-UP ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

click onto vite-project (within client folder) terminal

run: npm install        (npm is Node Package Manager & came with node, I am not sure what this even does, must find and install all the dependencies or smthing)

wait

run: npm run dev

should start

copy the local url (http://localhost:5173) & slap it into your browser

on the site enter in a title and contents for a note and click submit (this sends a request from the react frontend to the node backend which makes a command to mysql.  its a poc)

ALL Parts Proof of Concept ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

open a third terminal (for accessing database)

run: mysql -u root -p

password should be nothing now so just hit enter

run: use notes_app;

run: select * from notes;

put your hands together and pray that you see the note you created on frontend

CLEAN-UP ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

run: exit       (in mysql)

click on server terminal 

ctrl+C

click on client terminal

ctrl+C

enter: y

save everything
